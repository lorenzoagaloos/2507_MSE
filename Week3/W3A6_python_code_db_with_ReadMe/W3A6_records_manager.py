# Week 3 - Activity 6: Develop the python code for Week 3 - Activity 4 (lorenzoagaloos-270729354)
# Use the sample code to develop a command-line application for Week 3 ‚Äì Activity 4, incorporating a database sqlite3
# Should have at least three functionality such as add records, delete records and view records for different tables
# Should including a README.txt file in your repository to describe the technical aspects of this project (Yoobee Colleges)
